# Python_Cancer_Resaerch
Examination of Rat Tumor Data

This project was designed to examine the effects of certain medications using Python (Pandas). In this case, rats were used for the testing proceses of determing the tumor growth based off of the medication. 

I developed statistical results for my findings and discovered new fundings between different medications.
